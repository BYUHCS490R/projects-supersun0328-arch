        <h2>Interest - Indie games</h2>

        <span style="color: white;"> chose white to emphasize the text, since white can stands out from violet the most.</span></li>

        I chosed this pale violet color in order to make it less important than the titles.</li>
        <li><h2>How did you choose your colors? Did you use a tool online to help you find colors?</h2>
        Yes, I used paletton to choose my color for this project, I like purple, therefore, I started with checking the color palette of purple, realize it was a good combinition.</li>
