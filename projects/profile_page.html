    <h1>David Sun</h1>
    <p>Hello, <mark>David Sun</mark> here, I am a college student who interested in digital painting. One of the purpose I came to my current college is to practice it and polish my skill to the level that I can work as an artist. Currently, the different classes I attending are interesting and helpful, I am looking forward for the future classes. </p>
    <p>Besides Art, I also minored in Marketing and coding. As an artist, I believed that my minors can help me promoting myself and help me to reach my game design work goal. I also likes to cook, I worked in the kitchen rn.</p>

        <p>"And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. <strong>give unto men weakness that they may be humble</strong> ; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them."
